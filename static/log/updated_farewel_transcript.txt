You're one of the kindest people I've met - always positive and never angry!
By watching you work, I learned so much (secretly at first!).
You've been there for me since day one, explaining things patiently when we sat by the window near Starbucks. You're a big reason I'm still here!
You broke the stereotype of a strict manager - you're more like a supportive big brother who says "go for it, and I'll fix it if needed."
You encouraged us to explore and never limited us.
Your calmness inspires me, and I'll keep working on being more like you.
I loved celebrating your birthday! Hopefully we can do it again soon.
Thank you for everything - you're an amazing coworker and friend!
